# ðŸš€ TrackWise

**TrackWise** is a timeline-based portfolio and personal achievement tracker that brings storytelling and introspection into professional representation. Unlike static resumes, TrackWise allows users to chronologically organize their projects, experiences, milestones, and reflectionsâ€”giving depth, context, and continuity to their journey.

It's ideal as:
- A public-facing **portfolio**,
- A private **progress tracker**, or
- A smart **resume generator** with upcoming GitHub/LinkedIn/Notion integrations.
