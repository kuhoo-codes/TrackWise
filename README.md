# ðŸš€ TrackWise

**TrackWise** is a timeline-based portfolio and personal achievement tracker that brings storytelling and introspection into professional representation. Unlike static resumes, TrackWise allows users to chronologically organize their projects, experiences, milestones, and reflectionsâ€”giving depth, context, and continuity to their journey.

It's ideal as:
- A public-facing **portfolio**,
- A private **progress tracker**, or
- A smart **resume generator** with upcoming GitHub/LinkedIn/Notion integrations.

## Project Structure

```
TrackWise/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/            # FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL & Redis
â”œâ”€â”€ client/         # React + Vite frontend
â””â”€â”€ tools/          # Development scripts and utilities
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16+ 
- **PostgreSQL** 14+
- **Redis** 8+

## Setup

1. Initialize the Project
```bash
sh ./tools/init
```
*This sets up both backend and frontend environments in one command.*

2. Start Development Servers
```bash
./tools/run-dev
```

That's it! Your application will be running at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Redis**: http://localhost:6379
- **API Documentation**: 
  - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
  - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## ðŸ”§ Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up components individually:

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd api
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Database

TrackWise uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and Redis for caching. The initialization script handles database setup automatically, but ensure both services are running on your system.
